== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the deployment

To verify the deployment of the Atom in your Boomi account, first log in to https://platform.boomi.com/[AtomSphere^]. On the *Manage* menu, select *Atom Management*. The new Atom deployed by this Partner Solution is displayed under *Unattached Atoms*.

=== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

The Atom that is deployed by this Partner Solution can be managed from the Boomi AtomSphere dashboard. From the AtomSphere dashboard, you can https://help.boomi.com/bundle/integration/page/t-atm-Attaching_an_Atom_to_an_Enviro.html[attach^] the Atom to environments and deploy processes to it.

:xrefstyle: short
In <<deployed-atom>>, the Atom server is identified by the Domain Name System (DNS) name `ip-172-30-7.186.ec2.internal`. The account contains environments, one labeled *Production* and the other labeled *Test*.

=== Security

This Partner Solution deploys a bastion host and a Boomi Atom server into an AWS VPC. The bastion host is the only means of accessing the Atom at a command-line level. The Atom is deployed into a private subnet and cannot be reached through the internet. It communicates through a NAT gateway for updates and patches.

=== Performance Monitoring

Monitoring the CPU, network, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) performance of your Atom is done using CloudWatch metrics.

CPU and network performance is measured in utilization, network in and out, network packets in and out, and system status checks.

Amazon EBS volume performance is measured in read and write throughput, average read and write size, read and write bandwidth, read and write latency, and volume idle time. 

Further monitoring of disk space and inode consumption must be performed at the command line level of the EC2 instance using the `df -h` and `df -i` Linux commands.
