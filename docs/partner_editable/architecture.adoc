As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host to allow inbound SSH (Secure Shell) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, Boomi Atom installed on an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor EC2 instances and initiate recovery actions if an instance fails.

[.small]#*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

NOTE: Because of the limitations of single-use installation tokens, this Quick Start does not deploy Auto Scaling groups or load balancers. To deploy highly available Boomi Atom instances with multiple nodes and load balancing, consider deploying https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/dell-boomi-molecule/[Boomi Molecule on AWS^].
