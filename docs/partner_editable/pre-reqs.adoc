This Quick Start requires a Dell Boomi account. Also, to install Boomi Atom locally, you must have the following:

* Dell Boomi AtomSphere login credentials (user name and password) with permissions to create Atoms.
* A valid Boomi installer token that is compatible with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
